# HttpJettyServer
Http Server using Jetty 12 which exposes two endpoints /status and /task. Technologies I used to code this application are:

1. Oracle OpenJDK and JRE 22.0.1
2. Kotlin PL (language version 1.9, API version 1.9 and target platform JVM 1.8)
3. Maven 3.9.6
4. Intellij IDEA 2024.1.1 (Community Edition)
5. Jetty 12

There are a HTTP Server and a HTTP Client applications which are taken from the course [Distributed Systems & Cloud Computing with Java](https://www.udemy.com/course/distributed-systems-cloud-computing-with-java/). The Http Server, I coded using Jetty 12 and Kotlin, exposes the same endpoints as the one provided by Michael Pogrebinsky. In other words, they are identical regarding functionalities, but they used different technologies.
I used curl (command line tool), Postman and Http Client (provided in the course) to test the Http Server.
